            The action "Threat" by Petr Pavlensky is an expressive manifestation of his protest art. The essence of the action lies in the fact that fear, as a powerful force, can transform free individuals into helpless herds under constant surveillance, espionage, and control. The threat of reprisal looming over each of us who dares to express their point of view demonstrates power and political terror. Pavlensky opens society's eyes to the dark realities and fears that would otherwise remain unnoticed. His action serves as a reminder of the value of freedom and the necessity to defend human rights in a world where the threat always lurks nearby.
